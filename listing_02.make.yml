# Attributes are declared like this:
# attribute: value
# Attribute values with spaces and float-like string values must be quoted:
# attribute: 'long value'

# Core must be defined.
core: 8.x
# (Drush) api must be defined, always to '2'.
# version numbers that can be interpreted as floats must be quoted 
api: '2'

# Here you see the format of an array in a .make.yml-file. Indented text
# "inside" a parent are array keys, and each set to the right of the last is
# a layer deeper in the array. 

# Define the exact Drupal core version you need 
projects:
  drupal:
    # version numbers that can’t be interpreted as floats do not need quotes
    version: 8.2.3
  # Then define contrib modules etc.
  # Note that we’re still inside ‘projects’ –array/object, hence the indenting
  oauth:
    version: '2.0'
  commerce:
    subdir: commerce
    version: 2.0-beta3
# You may also provide default values to all projects
# Now OAuth and other modules with no subdir definition will be placed in
# sites/all/modules/contrib
defaults:
  projects:
    subdir: 'contrib'
